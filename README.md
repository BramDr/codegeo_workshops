# CodeGEO Workshops: Practical Insights on ML and Coding

The CodeGEO Workshops have been created from a group of people at the Physical Geography department, Utrecht University, to provide an easy way into machine learning for the people in our department. In this series of workshops, a short lecture is given on a ML/Coding related topic, followed by a practical part where the key concepts are exemplified in code through a Python Notebook. In this repository you can find such notebooks, so you can start learning ML from hands-on experience!
