# CodeGEO Workshops: Practical Insights on ML and Coding

The CodeGEO Workshops have been created from a group of people at the Physical Geography department, Utrecht University, to provide an easy way into machine learning for the people in our department. In this series of workshops, a short lecture is given on a ML/Coding related topic, followed by a practical part where the key concepts are exemplified in code through a Python Notebook. In this repository you can find such notebooks, so you can start learning ML from hands-on experience!

### Instructions for locally running the notebook

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), or your preferred conda distribution.

2. Download the *environment.yml* file from the Coding/ML group's @General channel. 

3. Create the conda environment from the Anaconda prompt at your fileâ€™s location.
```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
```

3. Activate the environment.
```bash
    conda activate codegeo_workshop
````

4. Start Jupyter notebook, or your preferred choice for reading .ipynb files. From there, you can select your file and start learning!
